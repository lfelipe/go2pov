Since the prog is written in very pure C++, it *should* run on any
plattform :-) (yes, AMIGA too). Nevertheless, I just test it for the
Linux and Win-plattform, so if you encounter any probs, I will try to
help.



Linux/Unix:
	untar/unzip
	compile
	copy the resulting executable to your favourite bin-path

Windoze:
	An executable file is within the windows-release, so there
	is no need to recompile it.

	Simply unzip all the stuff to a directory of your choice,
	run the prog from a DOS-Box to see all command-line-switches.
