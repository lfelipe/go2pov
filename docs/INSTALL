Since the prog is written in C++, it *should* run on any
plattform :-) (yes, AMIGA too). Nevertheless, I just test it for the
Linux. If you encounter any probs, I will try to help.

Please take also a look at the pov-scene in the samples-directory.


Linux/Unix:
	untar/unzip
	go into the go2pov-directory
	type "make" (if x-povray in path and "ee", try "make test" instead)
	if successfull, copy the resulting executable to your favourite bin-path

Windoze - not tested yet
