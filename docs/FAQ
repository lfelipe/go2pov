Q & A
*****
Q: 1. What is this program good for ?
A: The program will help you to make POV-files out of your Go-games. This
POV-files can be raytraced directly or you can use them in your POV-projects.
So POV can render/raytrace a picture of any resolution.

Q: 2. What is it not good for ?
A: The program will allow you to step thrue your Go-game, and to decide at
a specific point to write the current board to the hard-disk. All other
tasks should be done with other tools/progs/applications.

Q: 3. What do I need to run the program ?
A: In the moment the program is console-based so you need just a terminal
or a MS-DOS-Box. To raytrace the resulting files, you need POV
(http://www.povray.org)


Q: 4. Where can I find a so-called "SGF"-file ?
A: SGF stands for Simple Game Format (at least I hope so :) ).
Files can be found on all the go-related pages. Jan van der Steen
http://www.cwi.nl/~jansteen/go/go.html
has a very nice site with some (over 1.000) games. There you can find
older games, games between the Pro-Dans, etc....
A nice source is IGS. If you play there, be sure to set "automail" to "on", so
after the match you will find a nice SGF-file in your postboxes :)

Q: 5. What do all this files do ?
A: go2pov will create 3 files:
gotexture.inc, goboard.inc, sample.pov
The texture-file will just be created if it does not exist already.
That way you can define your very own textures for the board, the stones and
the grid.
The sample.pov just renders a simple scene with board and stones and nothing
more.
More advanced Pov-hackers will include the board from "goboard.inc" into
their own pov-scenes. The board stretches: -1<=x<=1, -1<=z<=1, -0.1<y<0.1
