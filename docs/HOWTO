Q & A
*****

1. What do I need ?
"go2-pov"-executable, povray (http://www.povray.org) and a sgf-file


2. How do I run the thing ?
The "go2pov" is not very complicated (for console-hackers at least).
 a) find the go2pov-executable and find a nice sgf-file
 b) run "go2pov <filename>"
 c) step thru the game by pressing return
 d) enter "s" + return to save the current board-position
 e) run POV (e.g.: "x-povray -I sample.pov +W640 +H480 +A0.3")
 f) view the resulting image ("sample.png")
